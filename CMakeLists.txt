# The onnx build on windows requires the provision of either static or shared libs for protobuf
# and to achieve that there are several different flags that need to be set in protobuf, onnx
# as well as cmake (for find_package). At the very minimum ONNX_USE_PROTOBUF_SHARED_LIBS and
# Protobuf_USE_STATIC_LIBS need to be opposites of each other, but onnx does not currently set them
# up that way (onnx doesn't set Protobuf_USE_STATIC_LIBS at all and cmake interprets that as setting
# Protobuf_USE_STATIC_LIBS to OFF). If/when onnx is updated to correctly set up both variables,
# this can be removed (see https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/3345).
