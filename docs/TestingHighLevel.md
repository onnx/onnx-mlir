# ONNX-MLIR: Build trouble-shooting and testing ONNX_MLIR

## Trouble shooting the building of ONNX-MLIR

If you have issues during the first `onnx-mlir` build, you may need to check the cmake variables used by our build. See the last section of this page for help.

If you have used the source directory successfully for a while, you may experience difficulties to rebuild `onnx-mlir` after merging the latest changes from the `main` branch.

Below is a couple of steps you may perform. If any of them apply, it is recommended to remove the `onnx-mlir/build` subdirectory and rebuild from scratch using the `cmake` commands.

### 1) Checking the right commit of the llvm-project

If the latest `onnx-mlir` `main` branch has moved to a newer commit level of the `llvm-project`, the build process will typically experience multiple compiler failures related to LLVM and MLIR code.

Level required is found in the first code box of the [Building ONNX-MLIR](BuildOnLinuxOSX.md#mlir) page next to the `git checkout` command.

Level used in the code is found by executing a `git log` in the `llvm-project` subdirectory.

If they don't match, please update the llvm project to the required level.

### 2) Checking the right third_party support

Typically, when we update the ONNX op level, it results in new software in the `third_party/onnx` subdirectory. Failing to update that code results typically in compiler failures related to ONNX dialect code.

It is easier to simply remove the `third_party` directory and then reinstalling the code using `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

### 3) Dialect update

Sometimes a dialect update requires the entire build directory to be rebuilt. Typical errors that you may see are missing declarations, for example to `verifier` methods. The recommendation is to simply remove the `onnx-mlir/build` subdirectory and rebuild from scratch using the `cmake` commands.

## High level testing of ONNX-MLIR

To run the lit ONNX-MLIR tests, use the following command:

[same-as-file]: <> ({"ref": "utils/check-onnx-mlir.cmd", "skip-ref": 1})
```shell
call cmake --build . --config Release --target check-onnx-lit
```

Or simply invoke the `check-onnx-lit` target for `ninja` or `make` in the build directory.

To run the numerical ONNX-MLIR tests, use the following command:

[same-as-file]: <> ({"ref": "utils/check-onnx-numerical.cmd", "skip-ref": 1})
```shell
call cmake --build . --config Release --target check-onnx-numerical
```

Or simply invoke the `check-onnx-numerical` target for `ninja` or `make` in the build directory.

To run the doc ONNX-MLIR tests, use the following command after installing third_party ONNX shown below. Details to first install the third_party ONNX project are detailed [here](BuildONNX.md). Note that it is key to install the ONNX project's version listed in our third_party subdirectory, as ONNX-MLIR may be behind the latest version from the ONNX standard.

[same-as-file]: <> ({"ref": "utils/check-docs.cmd", "skip-ref": 1})
```shell
call cmake --build . --config Release --target check-docs
```

Or simply invoke the `check-docs` target for `ninja` or `make` in the build directory.

# Summary of LLVM and ONNX-MLIR Cmake Variables

The following CMake variables from LLVM and ONNX-MLIR can be used when compiling ONNX-MLIR.

**MLIR_DIR**:PATH
  Path to to the mlir cmake module inside an llvm-project build or install directory (e.g., c:/repos/llvm-project/build/lib/cmake/mlir).
  This is required if **MLIR_DIR** is not already set from a previous cmake invocation.

**LLVM_EXTERNAL_LIT**:PATH
  Path to the lit tool. Defaults to an empty string and LLVM will find the tool based on **MLIR_DIR** if possible.
  This is required when **MLIR_DIR** points to an install directory.
