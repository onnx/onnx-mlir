# Supported ONNX Operation for Target *NNPA*.

Onnx-mlir currently supports ONNX operations targeting up to opset 14. Limitations are listed when applicable.

* Operations are defined by the [ONNX Standard](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Operators.md).
* Opset indicates, for each operation, the ONNX opset that (1) last modified that operation and (2) is supported by the current version of onnx-mlir. For example, "Add" was modified in Opset 14 and carries on unmodified to Opset 16. If onnx-mlir supports Opset 14, we thus list "14" as the Opset associated with the "Add" operation.


NNPA has hardware limitations in dimension index size and tensor size, which are described in [NNPALimit.h](../src/Accelerators/NNPA/Conversion/ONNXToZHigh/NNPALimit.h). They are enough large for normal use cases, but if your model exceeds the limitations, CPU is used instead of NNPA.
