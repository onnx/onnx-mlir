# Using PyRuntime

onnx-mlir has a runtime utility to run ONNX models compiled as a shared library
by `onnx-mlir --EmitLib`. The runtime is implemented in C++ by the `ExecutionSession` class
(src/Runtime/ExecusionSession.hpp) and has an associated Python binding generated by
[pybind library](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11).

## PyRuntime Module

Using pybind, a C/C++ binary can be directly imported by the Python interpreter. For onnx-mlir,
such binary is generated by `PyExecutionSession` (src/Runtime/PyExecutionSession.hpp) and built
as a shared library to `build/Debug/lib/PyRuntime.cpython-<target>.so`.

## Configuring and using PyRuntime

### Configuration
The module can be imported normally by the Python interpreter as long as it is in your
PYTHONPATH. Another alternative is to create a symbolic link to it in your working directory.

```shell
cd <working directory>
ln -s <path to PyRuntime>
python3
```

### Running the PyRuntime interface

Following is an example of how PyRuntime is leveraged in
an example program:
```python
import numpy as np
from PyRuntime import ExecutionSession

model = 'model.so' # LeNet from ONNX Zoo compiled with onnx-mlir
session = ExecutionSession(model)
print("input signature in json", session.input_signature())
print("output signature in json",session.output_signature())
input = np.full((1, 1, 28, 28), 1, np.dtype(np.float32))
outputs = session.run([input])

for output in outputs:
    print(output.shape)
```

## PyRuntime model API
The complete interface to ExecutionSession can be seen in the sources mentioned previously. However,
using the constructor and run method is enough to perform inferences.

```python
def __init__(self, path: str):
    """
    Args:
        path: relative or absolute path to your .so model.
    """

def run(self, input: List[ndarray]) -> List[ndarray]:
    """
    Args:
        input: A list of NumPy arrays, the inputs of your model.

    Returns:
        A list of NumPy arrays, the outputs of your model.
    """

def input_signature(self) -> str:
    """
    Returns:
        A string containing a JSON representation of the model's input signature.
    """

def output_signature(self) -> str:
    """
    Returns:
        A string containing a JSON representation of the model's output signature.
    """
```
