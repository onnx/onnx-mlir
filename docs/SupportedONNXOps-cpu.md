# Supported ONNX Operation for Target *cpu*.

Onnx-mlir currently supports ONNX operations targeting up to opset 16. Limitations are listed when applicable.

* Operations are defined by the [ONNX Standard](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Operators.md).
* Opset indicates, for each operation, the ONNX opset that (1) last modified that operation and (2) is supported by the current version of onnx-mlir. For example, "Add" was modified in Opset 14 and carries on unmodified to Opset 16. If onnx-mlir supports Opset 14, we thus list "14" as the Opset associated with the "Add" operation.
