/**
 * Place all operations that qualify for NNPA execution on the NNPA when the
 * operations are estimated run faster on the NNPA, including the costs of Stick
 * and Unstick necessary for NNPA execution. The algorithm starts to place on
 * the CPU/NNPA operations that are significantly faster on CPU/NNPA. Then it
 * aims to add operations to the NNPA when the new operations are faster
 * including the additional (if any) stick/unstick required for these less
 * significantly faster NNPA operations. Three factors below can modify the
 * sensitivity at which ops are assigned to the NNPA.
 *
 * @param context Context of the model.
 * @param ops ONNX ops that should be considered in the device assignment.
 * @param dimAnalysis Pointer to dimension analysis tool for disambiguating
 * dynamic shape dimensions.
 * @param cpuOps Set of ops that must execute on CPU.
 * @param minFactor NNPA (including stick/unstick) has to be at least minFactor
 * times faster than CPU for an op to be assigned to the NNPA.
 * @param significantCPUFactor CPU has to be at least significantFactor faster
 * than NNPA to seed/force computations on the CPU.
 * @param significantNNPAFactor NNPA has to be at least significantFactor faster
 * than CPU to seed/force computations on the NNPA.
 *
 * @note The significantCPUFactor can be smaller, as if it's not looking good
 * for the NNPA, we may as well seed the computation on CPU for ops that are
 * much better on the CPU. For significantNNPAFactor, we may want it much higher
 * as we might want only to send there really beneficial ops on the NNPA.
 * Combining a high significantNNPAFactor with a large minFactor, the heuristic
 * will put only ops that are really beneficial on the NNPA.
