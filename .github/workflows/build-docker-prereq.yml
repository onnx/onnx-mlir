# This workflow will run whenever there is a change to the version of LLVM the project is based on
# It will create a new Docker image for the TravisCI build and push it to Docker Hub
# This image contains the prereqs for building onnx-mlir including a precompiled copy of the appropriate
# LLVM and MLIR code.
# 
# To make this work on your fork you need to enable the github workflow and set a personal access token for your
# docker hub account in the github secrets.
# When the action succeeds it will put the prereq image in your docker hub repository.
